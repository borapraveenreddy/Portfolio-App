## 📌 About the Project

**Portfolio-App** is a simple and lightweight portfolio builder website that allows users to quickly create and manage their own personal portfolio.  
Without writing any code, users can fill out a few details (about, skills, projects, contact, etc.) and instantly generate a clean portfolio page.

The app includes basic authentication (register / login), a guided portfolio builder, live preview of the portfolio, and a page to view all created portfolios. It’s a good starter project for understanding form handling, basic auth flows, and dynamic DOM updates using vanilla JavaScript.
